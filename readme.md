# VirtualTabs ‚Äì Organize Open Files into Smart Groups

> **Group your open files by custom rules or file extensions to keep your VS Code workspace organized.**

## üîç Project Overview

**VirtualTabs** is a simple and practical VS Code extension that provides file grouping management, helping you organize and switch between files more efficiently in multi-file development environments. Through the "Virtual Tabs" TreeView in the sidebar, it supports auto-grouping, custom group management, drag-and-drop, and advanced batch operations for multiple files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* Only the "Currently Open Files" group auto-syncs with VS Code's open/close state
* Other custom groups require manual or drag-and-drop file management
* Auto group by extension requires a specific group to be selected first
* Built-in group does not support "one-click open/close" (since files are already open)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why can't I see the "Virtual Tabs" view?

Please check:

1. The extension is properly installed and enabled
2. The "Virtual Tabs" section appears in the Explorer sidebar
3. In development mode, press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host

### How do I perform batch file operations?

1. **Multi-select files**: Hold `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (macOS) and click multiple files
2. **Right-click actions**: Right-click selected files and choose the desired operation
3. **Supported actions**: Open, close, or remove selected files from group

### How does auto group by extension work?

1. Select a group containing files (click the group name)
2. Right-click and choose "Auto Group by Extension"
3. The system will create multiple "[Auto] .extension" groups based on file extensions in the selected group

### How do I remove a single file from a group?

For custom groups:

1. **Trash icon**: Click the trash icon next to the file item
2. **Context menu**: Right-click the file item and select "Remove from Group"

Note: The built-in group "Currently Open Files" does not support removing individual files.

### What if drag-and-drop doesn't work?

Check the following:

1. The target must be a group (folder icon), not a file
2. Dragging files from File Explorer into a group is supported
3. Dragging files between groups is supported
4. Make sure your VS Code version meets the requirement (^1.75.0)

### Are group data saved?

Yes, group data are automatically saved in:

* VS Code's `workspaceState`
* Automatically saved after each operation
* Automatically loaded when reopening the workspace
