# Change Log

All notable changes to the "VirtualTabs" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-21

> **Special Thanks**: [@jianfulin](https://github.com/jianfulin) for the major contribution! 🎉

### Added

- **Group Reordering**: Move groups up or down via context menu commands.
- **Executable File Support**: `.bat` and `.exe` files now have an inline "Run" button. Clicking the file itself still opens it in editor for consistency.
- **Expanded State Persistence**: Remember which groups are expanded/collapsed across VS Code restarts.
- Persist group/bookmark data to `.vscode/virtualTab.json`.
- Store file references in `virtualTab.json` as paths relative to the workspace root.

### Changed

- **Storage Location**: Moved `virtualTab.json` from workspace root to `.vscode/virtualTab.json` for cleaner project structure.
- Allow duplicate group names when IDs differ.

### Fixed

- Improved shell command quoting for cross-platform terminal execution.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Sub-Groups & Nested Structure**: Create hierarchical group organization by adding sub-groups or dragging groups onto each other.
- **AI Context Export**: Copy all files in a group as LLM-ready markdown with "Copy Context for AI" command.
- **Unified Copy Menu**: New submenu with smart behavior - copies work differently on groups vs files.
- **Directory Drag & Drop**: Drag folders from Explorer to recursively add all files within.
- **Copy/Paste/Delete Commands**: Full clipboard operations for files and groups within VirtualTabs.
- **Multi-select Delete**: Delete multiple groups or files at once.
- **File Move with Bookmarks**: Dragging files between groups preserves their bookmarks.

### Changed

- Groups now require unique IDs for stable references (auto-migrated from older versions).
- Improved drag-and-drop controller with better file/group/directory detection.
- Context menus reorganized with separate submenus for different item types.
- Copy File Name/Path commands now work on groups (copies all files recursively).

### Fixed

- Fixed bookmark preservation when moving files between groups.
- Improved error handling for large file context copying.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **Task-Oriented Bookmarks**: You can now add bookmarks to specific lines of code within your VirtualTabs groups.
- **Smart Flow**: Right-click to add bookmarks instantly without annoying input boxes. The system automatically labels them based on line content.
- **Bookmark Navigation**: Click on a bookmark in the sidebar to jump directly to the code location.
- **Bookmark Management**: Edit bookmark labels and descriptions, or remove them via the context menu.

### Changed

- Improved TreeView performance when handling groups with many files.
- Updated `package.json` to include new bookmark commands and menus.

### Fixed
